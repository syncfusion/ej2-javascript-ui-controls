# ej2-layouts

The layout package contains cards, avatars, splitter and Dashboard Layout controls.

* The `card` is a small container in which user can show defined content in specific structure.

* The `avatars` are icons, initials or figures representing a particular person, used in popular media formats like images, SVG, font icons, and letters.

* The `splitter` is container control which used to construct different layouts using multiple and nested panes.

* The `DashboardLayout` is a grid structured layout control that helps to create a dashboard with panels. Panels hold the UI components and allow resize, reorder, drag-n-drop, remove and add options. This allows users to easily place the components at the desired position within the grid layout.
