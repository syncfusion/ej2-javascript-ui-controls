* **Drag and Drop**: Cards can be easily dragged and dropped from one column to other and also supports to drag from one swimlane to another.
* **Template**: The key elements such as cards, column header, swimlane and tooltip comes with the default template support that allows the flexible end-user customization to embed any kind of text, images, or styles to it.
* **Adaptive rendering**: Adapts with optimal user interfaces for mobile and desktop form-factors, thus helping the user’s application to scale elegantly across all the form-factors without any additional effort.
* **Keyboard interaction**: All the common actions such as traversing through the cards, multiple card selection, add, edit, or delete the cards, drag and drop to other column or swimlane and much more can be performed through keyboard inputs.
