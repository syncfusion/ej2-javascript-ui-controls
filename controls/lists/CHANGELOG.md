# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### ListView

#### Breaking Changes

- Using a ternary operator within the string-type template is not supported and we suggest using a function type template in ListView. Refer to the below code for example

**Previous**

```typescript

let template: string = '<div class="e-list-wrapper e-list-avatar" id = ${id}>' +
        '<span class="e-list-content">${name} ${$imgUrl ?  $imgUrl : \'no image\' }</span></div>';
```

**Now**

```typescript

// data denotes the template data of each nodes from ListView data.
let template: Function = (data: any) => {
    let result = `<div class="e-list-wrapper e-list-avatar" id = "${data.id}">`+
    `<span class="e-list-content">${data.name} ${data.imgUrl ?  data.imgUrl : 'no image' }</span></div>`;
    return result;
}
```
