     * * `catalog`: Allows to set the database name of SSAS cube as string type that used to retrieve the data from the specified connection string. **Note: It is applicable only for OLAP data source.**
     * * `cube`: Allows you to set the SSAS cube name as string type that used to retrieve data for pivot table rendering. **Note: It is applicable only for OLAP data source.**

     * * `url`: Allows to set the URL as string type, which helps to identify the service endpoint where the data are processed and retrieved to render the pivot table and field list. **Note: It is applicable only for OLAP data source.**
     * * `localeIdentifier`: Allows you to set the specific culture code as number type to render pivot table with desired localization.
     * By default, the pivot table displays with culture code **1033**, which indicates "en-US" locale. **Note: It is applicable only for OLAP data source.**
     * * `dataSource`: Allows you to set the data source to the pivot report either as JSON data collection or from remote data server using DataManager to the render the pivot that and field list. **Note: It is applicable only for relational data source.**
     * * `rows`: Allows specific fields associated with field information that needs to be displayed in row axis of pivot table.
     * * `columns`: Allows specific fields associated with field information that needs to be displayed in column axis of pivot table.
     * * `values`: Allows specific fields associated with field information that needs to be displayed as aggregated numeric values in pivot table.
     * * `filters`: Allows to filter the values in other axis based on the collection of filter fields in pivot table.
     * * `excludeFields`: Allows you to restrict the specific field(s) from displaying it in the field list UI.

     * * `expandAll`: Allows you to either expand or collapse all the headers that are displayed in the pivot table.
     * By default, all the headers are collapsed in the pivot table. **Note: It is applicable only for Relational data.**

     * * `filterSettings`: Allows specific fields associated with either selective or conditional-based filter members that used to be displayed in the pivot table.
     * * `sortSettings`: Allows specific fields associated with sort settings to order their members either in ascending or descending that used to be displayed in the pivot table.
     * By default, the data source containing fields are display with Ascending order alone. To use this option, it requires the `enableSorting` property to be **true**.
     * * `enableSorting`: Allows to perform sort operation to order members of a specific fields either in ascending or descending that used to be displayed in the pivot table.
     * * `formatSettings`: Allows specific fields used to display the values with specific format that used to be displayed in the pivot table.
     * For example, to display a specific field with currency formatted values in the pivot table, the set the `format` property to be **C**.
     * * `drilledMembers`: Allows specific fields to with specify the headers that used to be either expanded or collapsed in the pivot table.

     * * `showHeaderWhenEmpty`: Allows the undefined headers to be displayed in the pivot table, when the specific field(s) are not defined in the raw data.
     * For example, if the raw data for the field ‘Country’ is defined as “United Kingdom” and “State” is not defined means, it will be shown as “United Kingdom >> Undefined” in the header section.
     * * `alwaysShowValueHeader`: Allows to show the value field header always in pivot table, even if it holds a single field in the value field axis.
     * * `conditionalFormatSettings`: Allows a collection of values fields to change the appearance of the pivot table value cells with different style properties such as background color, font color, font family, and font size based on specific conditions.
     * * `emptyCellsTextContent`: Allows to show custom string to the empty value cells that used to display in the pivot table. You can fill empty value cells with any value like “0”, ”-”, ”*”, “(blank)”, etc.
     * * `groupSettings`: Allows specific fields to group their data on the basis of their type.
     * For example, the date type fields can be formatted and displayed based on year, quarter, month, and more. Likewise, the number type fields can be grouped range-wise, such as 1-5, 6-10, etc.
     * You can perform custom group to the string type fields that used to displayed in the pivot table.
     * * `authentication`: Allows you to set the credential information to access the specified SSAS cube. Note: It is applicable only for OLAP data source.
