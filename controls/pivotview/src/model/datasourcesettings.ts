/**
 * Allows specific fields associated with field information that needs to be displayed in the field axes of pivot table. The following configurations which are applicable are as follows:
 * * `name`: Allows you to set the field name that needs to be displayed in row/column/value/filter axis of pivot table.
 * * `caption`: Allows you to set caption to the specific field. It will be used to display instead of its name in pivot table component's UI.
 * * `type`: Allows to display the values in the pivot table with appropriate aggregations such as sum, product, count, average, etc… **Note: It is applicable only for relational data source.**
 * * `axis`: Allows you to set the axis name to the specific field. This will help to display the field in specified axis such as row/column/value/filter axis of pivot table.
 * * `showNoDataItems`: Allows you to display all members items of a specific field to the pivot table,
 * even doesn't have any data in its row/column intersection in data source. **Note: It is applicable only for relational data source.**
 * * `baseField`: Allows you to set the selective field, which used to display the values with either
 *  DifferenceFrom or PercentageOfDifferenceFrom or PercentageOfParentTotal aggregate types. **Note: It is applicable only for relational data source.**
 * * `baseItem`: Allows you to set the selective item of a specific field, which used to display the values with either DifferenceFrom or PercentageOfDifferenceFrom aggregate types.
 * The selective item should be set the from field specified in the baseField property. **Note: It is applicable only for relational data source.**
 * * `showSubTotals`: Allows to show or hide sub-totals to a specific field in row/column axis of the pivot table.
 * * `isNamedSet`: Allows you to set whether the specified field is a named set or not. In general,
 * the named set is a set of dimension members or a set expression (MDX query) to be created as a dimension in the SSAS OLAP cube itself. **Note: It is applicable only for OLAP data source.**
 * * `isCalculatedField`: Allows to set whether the specified field is a calculated field or not.
 * In general, the calculated field is created from the bound data source or using simple formula with basic arithmetic operators in the pivot table. **Note: It is applicable only for OLAP data source.**
 * * `showFilterIcon`: Allows you to show or hide the filter icon of a specific field that used to be displayed on the pivot button of the grouping bar and field list UI.
 * This filter icon is used to filter the members of a specified field at runtime in the pivot table.
 * * `showSortIcon`: Allows you to show or hide the sort icon of a specific field that used to be displayed in the pivot button of the grouping bar and field list UI.
 * This sort icon is used to order members of a specified field either in ascending or descending at runtime.
 * * `showRemoveIcon`: Allows you to show or hide the remove icon of a specific field that used to be displayed in the pivot button of the grouping bar and field list UI.
 * This remove icon is used to remove the specified field during runtime.
 * * `showValueTypeIcon`: Allows you to show or hide the value type icon of a specific field that used to be displayed in the pivot button of the grouping bar and field list UI.
 * This value type icon helps to select the appropriate aggregation type to specified value field at runtime.
 * * `showEditIcon`: Allows you to show or hide the edit icon of a specific field that used to be displayed on the pivot button of the grouping bar and field list UI.
 * This edit icon is used to modify caption, formula, and format of a specified calculated field at runtime that to be displayed in the pivot table.
 * * `allowDragAndDrop`: Allows you to restrict the specific field's pivot button that is used to drag on runtime in the grouping bar and field list UI.
 * This will prevent you from modifying the current report.
 * * `expandAll`: Allows you to either expand or collapse all of the headers in the pivot table for a specific field.
