# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## 23.1.36 (2023-09-15)

### PivotTable

#### Breaking Changes

- The skeleton (aka, HTML) of the pivot table has been restructured. Previously, the pivot table displayed frozen row headers and values data in a two-table manner. It has been simplified to one table. The appearance of the horizontal scrollbar has changed as the row headers were frozen using the CSS attributes. However, the pivot table's appearance will remain unchanged as the prior version.

- Because the DOM structure of the pivot table has changed, the following classes included elements have been removed and can now be identified using the classes listed below.

- The frozen and moveable header elements have now been identified within the `e-gridheader` element using the class names shown below.

| Previous | Now | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `e-frozenheader > e-table > th.e-headercell` | `e-table > th.e-leftfreeze.e-headercell` | Element defining the frozen column header. |
| `e-movableheader > e-table > th.e-headercell` | `e-table > th.e-unfreeze.e-headercell` | Element defining the moveable column header. |

- The frozen and moveable content elements have now been identified within the `e-gridcontent` element using the class names shown below.

| Previous | Now | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `e-frozencontent > e-table > th.e-rowcell` | `e-table > th.e-leftfreeze.e-rowcell` | Element defining the frozen content (aka, row headers). |
| `e-movablecontent > e-table > th.e-rowcell` | `e-table > th.e-unfreeze.e-rowcell` | Element defining the moveable content (aka, values). |

### Pivot Grid

The pivot grid is a multi-dimensional data visualization component built on top of the relational data sources. The pivot report can be managed dynamically at runtime along with other capabilities like aggregation, filtering and sorting (field and value based).

- **Data Sources** - Binds the component with an array of JavaScript objects.
- **Filtering** - Allows user to view only specific/desired records in the component.
- **Sorting** - Both member and value sorting are supported. It’s allows user to order fields and values (column) either in ascending or descending order respectively.
- **Field List & Grouping Bar** - Supports UI interaction at runtime to dynamically change the report along with sorting, filtering and remove options.
- **Aggregation** - Provides built in aggregation types like sum, average, min, max and count.
- **Calculated Field** - Users can add new value field(s) to the report dynamically using this option.
- **Adaptive Rendering** - Adapts with optimal user interfaces for mobile and desktop form-factors, thus helping the user’s application to scale elegantly across all the form-factors without any additional effort.
- **Exporting** - Provides the option to exporting records to Excel, CSV and PDF formats.
