The [JavaScript Query Builder](https://www.syncfusion.com/javascript-ui-controls/js-query-builder?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=javascript-query-builder-npm) control is a rich and responsive UI for filtering large amounts of data by creating or editing conditions that can be combined with data visualization controls like DataGrid and Charts to view the filtered data. It outputs structured JSON that can be easily parsed to create SQL queries. It allows you to create conditions and group them using AND/OR logic.

## Key features

* [Data Sources](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/query-builder/data-binding): The Query Builder can be bound to a variety of data sources, including arrays of JSON objects, complex data structures such as nested objects or arrays, and Data Manager. This allows users to filter data from a wide range of sources.
* [Template](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/query-builder/templates): The Query Builder offers templates that allow users to create custom user experiences by customizing the user interface for individual values, the entire rule, and the group header. This allows users to tailor the Query Builder to their specific needs and preferences.
* [Importing and Exporting](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/query-builder/import-export): The Query Builder allows users to export filters or conditions as SQL and structured JSON, and to import these filters into the Query Builder for regeneration. This makes it easy for users to save and share their filters with others.
* [Model Binding](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/query-builder/model-binding):  The Query Builder allows users to bind properties for the components used in the field, operator, and value user interfaces, allowing users to define the behavior and appearance of these components.
* [RTL support](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/query-builder/how-to/rtl): The Query Builder supports RTL (right-to-left) mode, which aligns content from right to left. This is useful for languages that are written in a right-to-left script, such as Arabic.
* [Localization](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/query-builder/global-local): The Query Builder provides inherent support for localization, allowing users to easily translate the user interface into different languages. This makes the Query Builder more accessible to users who speak languages other than English.
* Rich and responsive UI: The Query Builder provides a user-friendly interface for creating and editing conditions, making it easy for users to filter large amounts of data.
* AND/OR logic: The Query Builder allows users to group conditions using AND/OR logic, giving them greater control over the filtered data.
* Integration with data visualization controls: The Query Builder can be used in conjunction with data visualization controls like DataGrid and Charts to view the filtered data, providing a more comprehensive view of the data.
* Easy to use: The Query Builder is easy to use and can be easily integrated into any project, making it a convenient and powerful tool for filtering data.
