### QueryBuilder

The Query Builder component is a graphical user interface that allows users to create and edit filters. It outputs a structured JSON of filters which that can be easily parsed to create SQL. It is integrated with Data Manager to communicates with data sources and returns the desired result based on the provided filter. It supports data binding, templates, validation, and horizontal and vertical orientation.

- **Data binding**: It auto populates the data source and maps the data to the appropriate fields.

- **Template**: Supports templates and it is applicable for all input components.

- **Queries**: Queries supports JSON/SQL rules.
